- [Running cron jobs on AWS Lambda with Scheduled Events](https://medium.com/blogfoster-engineering/running-cron-jobs-on-aws-lambda-with-scheduled-events-e8fe38686e20)
- [Serverless | Quick Start](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/quick-start/)

```

A file at `~/.aws/credentials` will be created and we're ready to deploy and launch our code through serverless
